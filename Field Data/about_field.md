This sub-directory contains all of the field data that was collected to compare with the model for each community in New Jersey that nourished their beaches 
in the spreadsheet "NJ_Field_Data.xlsx". Shoreline extraction was conducted using CoastSat (Vos et al., 2019). All corresponding codes, output data files,
reference shoreline files, transect location files, and data processing spreadsheets are included and listed by community (i.e., within its own sub-directory).
